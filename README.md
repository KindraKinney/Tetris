# Tetris

Tetris was one of my favorite games growing up, so I wanted to create my own version. 

This was made by following a tutorial by Ania Kubow https://github.com/kubowania to create the basic functionaility of the game. I am going to redo the styling the game, increase the highest score point and to save high scores. 

## Technologies Used 

* HTML
* CSS 
* Javascript

## Play Me!
